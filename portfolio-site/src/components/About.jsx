        <p>
          Hi, I'm Charu, a soon to be graduate from the University of Birmingham! On this site, I wanted to 
          showcase my experience in a more hands-on way. Within software development, my passion truly lies with 
          ensuring everything I produce is accessible for as many users as possible, whilst still being clean and
          efficient.
        </p>
        <p>
        Please take a look around:<br />
        - the Education page will tell you more about previous projects I've worked on for University coursework, 
        and the work I've undertaken as part of my apprenticeship with PwC. <br />
        - the Skills page shows some of the programming languages and tools that I have used, along with any
        other relevant qualifications. It is much less detailed if you just want a quick scan!
