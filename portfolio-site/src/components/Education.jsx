    <p>Throughout my degree apprenticeship, I have balanced theoretical and practical knowledge,
      in order to gain a well rounded view of the industry. This page is separated into University and
      Industry based learning.
    </p>
     <h2>University</h2>
      <h3>Overview of Theoretical Modules</h3>
      <p>Below are some examples of modules I have taken during my time at university:</p>
      <h4>Artificial Intelligence I</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Demonstrated understanding of traditional AI approaches.</li>
        <li>Applied core principles of AI to solve problems.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Data Structure & Algorithms</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed and implemented data structures and algorithms.</li>
        <li>Argued correctness and derived complexity measures.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Mathematical and Logical Foundations of Computer Science</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Applied mathematical models of computations.</li>
        <li>Wrote formal proofs for propositional and predicate logic</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Theories of Computation</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Applied concepts from automata theory, formal language theory, 
            computability theory, and complexity theory.</li>
        <li>Explained non-computability and undecidability issues.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Artificial Intelligence II</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Understood principles of inference and data fitting in uncertain AI models.</li>
        <li>Described and understood randomized search and optimization techniques in AI.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Security and Networks</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand basic concepts of cryptography</li>
        <li>Understand the threats to data stored, or sent on the network along with how to mitigate
          those threats </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Team Projects</h3>
      <p>I have been involved with a few team projects as part of university assignments. One of these involved
         developing a Car Share web application which would allow employees of a company to organise who they
         would travel with, and track the carbon emissions of different transport options. </p>
     <h2>Apprenticeship</h2> 
      <h3>Apps Script</h3>
        <p>
          In my first summer placement, I was tasked with producing a solution for automatic report 
          generation using Google Apps Script. This involved using the JavaScript-based language of
          the G-suite IDE, in order to manipulate data in a Google Sheet as a reult of event triggers.
        </p>
      <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>
          During a six week rotation into a web development team, I collaborated on a project aiming to 
          improve the firm's options for a real-time captioning tool. As a group of apprentices, we built
          this tool from scratch, providing additional functionality to transcribe the captions to a pdf 
          and update appearance in a separate Captions Settings page.
        </p>
        <p>
          This made use of HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and React, as well as the Google Speech-to-Text API. We 
          utilised Git to ensure code management was simple, working with branching strategies to organize 
          and track code changes. The project developed in an Agile way, making use of Jira Software for 
          task tracking and sprint planning.
        </p>
        <p>
          I focused heavily on ensuring this site  was accessible by people with disabilities, using 
          ARIA roles where appropriate and ensuring the site met WCAG guidelines. Additionally, I worked 
          closely with an accessibility auditor to assess the site's flaws and document them for future
          development. 
        </p>
     <h3>Client Facing Project</h3>
      <p>
        As part of my year in industry, I was involved with a large scale data migration project. As a 
        result, I developed many skills including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Working closely with stakeholders to understand requirements.</li>
        <li>Producing key deliverables, including a Data Mapping document to map source 
          and target systems</li>
        <li>Collaborating with multiple teams, across both my firm and the client</li>
        <li>Leading key client workshops, to resolve outstanding queries during the 
          migration process</li>
        <li>Supervising another team member in daily activities related to data 
          mapping and production of user stories.</li>
      </ul>
    </>
